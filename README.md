# Blender-Script---Shell-Generator

- Description

It has an Options sections.
You can choose how many shells you want and the distance between them.
Every option have a description at it's side.

Very usefull for 3D artists who want to create "shell based fur".

- Usage

In object mode, select the base object from which you want to generate shells.
In Blender's "Text Editor" (Shift + F11) open the script.
Click run (or press Alt + P).

- NOTES:

The script is heavy.
It was tested on a base object of 7400 vertices using a Ryzen 5600g +16GB 3200mhz RAM (no graphics card) and it took 40 seconds to generate each shell.
Due to how heavy it is, it might crash during the process (very unusual). If this happens you can delete the shell objects and try again.
